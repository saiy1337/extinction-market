# Extinction Market Bot
Since i've been banned from Extinction FiveM GTA Server, i decided to release my market bot
This version is a old version of my bot which 

UPDATE :
Not banned anymore, but this bot is still shitty.

To make it faster you will need :

Proxies, setup a axios proxy setup with paid proxies from a premium proxy site or a shitty one, and try to get some proxies located near france.
After that you will be having no rate-limit and can spam the extinction api to make your bot the "fastest", just blasting the api with requests wont make your bot faster.

hence if you dont have proxies, you will need to stick with 1.5s/2s delay.
